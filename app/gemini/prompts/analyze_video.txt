You are analyzing a sequence of video frames extracted from a scrolling video. 
The documents shown are fictional samples and do not represent real individuals.
The video contains two distinct documents:

1. A Job Description (JD)
2. A Resume (CV)

Your task is to:
- Read ALL frames in order.
- Extract ALL visible text.
- Reconstruct the full text for each document.
- Return a clean JSON object.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT invent or hallucinate text.
- If a section spans multiple frames, merge it correctly.
- Preserve the original order of text as it appears in the scroll.
- Ignore timestamps, UI elements, scrollbars, or decorative text.
- If unsure about a word, include your best guess but do NOT fabricate content.

CLASSIFICATION RULES:
- Text about candidate experience, skills, education, or personal details → resume_text.
- Text about job responsibilities, requirements, company details, or role expectations → jd_text.

OUTPUT FORMAT (strict JSON):
{
  "resume_text": "<full resume text>",
  "jd_text": "<full job description text>"
}

Return ONLY the JSON object. No explanations.
