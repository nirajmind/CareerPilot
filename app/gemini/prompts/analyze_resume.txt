Analyze the following resume and job description.

Your task:  
- Extract structured information from the resume.  
- Extract structured information from the job description.  
- Compare them strictly based on explicit text.  
- Generate a fitgraph.  
- Produce ALL sections required by the API schema.  
- Do NOT infer or assume geographic location unless explicitly provided. If no location is present, treat location as “Not specified” and do not guess.  
- Do NOT infer or assume any information that is not explicitly written in the resume or job description.  
- Do NOT use external knowledge.  
- Do NOT be creative or embellish.  
- Do NOT add skills, tools, technologies, responsibilities, or experience that are not explicitly stated.  
- Do NOT invent metrics, percentages, achievements, or performance claims.  
- Do NOT expand project descriptions beyond what is explicitly written.  
- Do NOT infer seniority, job level, company size, industry, or domain unless explicitly stated.  
- Hidden signals must be derived ONLY from patterns explicitly present in the text. Do NOT guess.  
- If uncertain, return an empty string or empty array.  
- All reasoning must be strictly grounded in the provided text.  
- Output MUST be deterministic and must not vary across runs.  

Return ONLY valid JSON in the EXACT structure below.  
DO NOT add or remove fields.  
DO NOT include markdown fences.  
DO NOT include commentary.  
DO NOT include any text before or after the JSON.
