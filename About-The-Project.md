🔥 CareerPilot — Autonomous Multimodal Job Application Agent
CareerPilot is an Action‑Era AI application powered by the Gemini 3 API.
It transforms the job‑application process by acting as a multimodal, autonomous agent that analyzes resumes, job descriptions, and even video scrolls of job posts to generate a tailored, high‑impact application package.
Built for the Gemini 3 Global Hackathon, CareerPilot showcases advanced reasoning, long‑context understanding, and agentic task execution — going far beyond traditional RAG or prompt‑based chatbots.

🚀 What CareerPilot Does
- Multimodal Parsing: Understands PDFs, DOCX, screenshots, and video recordings of job posts.
- Agentic Workflow: Plans and executes multi‑step tasks such as resume optimization, skill‑gap analysis, and application preparation.
- FitGraph Engine: Visualizes alignment between a candidate’s experience and job requirements using structured reasoning.
- Grounded Resume Rewriting: Uses RAG to rewrite resume sections based on verified experience — no hallucinations.
- Hiring Manager Simulation: Provides feedback on candidate fit, communication clarity, and missing competencies.

🧠 Why This Project Stands Out
CareerPilot is designed specifically for the Action Era:
- Not a simple chatbot
- Not a prompt wrapper
- Not baseline RAG
- Not a generic resume tool
Instead, it is a high‑fidelity orchestrator that leverages Gemini 3’s multimodal reasoning, long‑context capabilities, and autonomous planning to deliver a real, production‑grade experience.

🏗️ Tech Stack
- Gemini 3 API (multimodal + agentic reasoning)
- AI Studio (rapid prototyping)
- Python/Java backend (agent orchestrator)
- Vector DB (RAG grounding)
- Frontend Web App (resume/JD upload, FitGraph visualization)

👥 Team
A 3‑member engineering team led by Niraj Kumar Adhikary, responsible for system architecture, agent orchestration, and RAG pipeline design.
