⭐ 2. How to Track Test Cases, Scores, and Improvements
You need a structured way to:
- Upload a resume
- Upload a JD
- Capture Gemini’s output
- Score the FitGraph
- Track skill gaps
- Track mock interview performance
- Track resume rewrite quality
- Track improvements over time
This is exactly what a test dataset spreadsheet is for.

Test Case ID|Resume Name|JD Name|Experience Level|Fit Score|Matching Skills|Missing Skills|Skill Matrix Summary|Prep Plan Quality (1–5)|Mock Interview Depth (1–5)|Resume Rewrite Quality (1–5)|JSON Output Valid? (Y/N)|Notes / Issues													



⭐ Column Explanation (so your team understands it)
Fit Score
From Gemini’s FitGraph (0–100).
Matching Skills / Missing Skills
Copy directly from Gemini’s output.
Skill Matrix Summary
A short summary like:
- Strong in Python fundamentals
- Weak in concurrency
- Needs improvement in SQL
Prep Plan Quality
Rate 1–5 based on:
- Relevance
- Depth
- Actionability
Mock Interview Depth
Rate 1–5 based on:
- Follow‑up questions
- Technical depth
- Behavioral coverage
Resume Rewrite Quality
Rate 1–5 based on:
- Clarity
- Impact
- ATS alignment
JSON Output Valid?
Mark Y/N depending on whether Gemini produced the JSON block correctly.
Notes / Issues
Use this to track:
- Missing JSON
- Wrong structure
- Missing skill matrix
- Tone issues
- Incorrect FitGraph

⭐ 3. Why this sheet matters
This becomes your ground truth dataset for:
- Improving prompts
- Measuring Gemini’s consistency
- Training your team
- Benchmarking new versions
- Debugging LangGraph nodes later
- Evaluating model upgrades (Flash → Pro → Ultra)
This is how real AI products evolve.

🎯 Prep Plan Quality Scoring Rubric (1–5 Scale)
This rubric evaluates the clarity, relevance, depth, and actionability of the preparation plan generated by Gemini.

Score | Description
------|---------------------------------------------------------------
1     | Vague, generic advice. No clear steps. No prioritization.
2     | Some relevant skills mentioned, but lacks structure.
3     | Clear steps and relevant skills. Priorities mentioned.
4     | Well-structured plan with prioritized skills. Some personalization.
5     | Highly personalized, deeply relevant. Feels like a mentor’s guidance.




🧠 How to Score Automatically (Python Logic)
You can write a function that checks:
- ✅ Does it include priority levels (high, medium, low)?
- ✅ Are the skills specific and relevant to the JD?
- ✅ Are the steps actionable (e.g., “Build a REST API using Flask”)?
- ✅ Is there a sense of progression or timeline?
- ✅ Does it feel personalized to the resume’s gaps?
Each “yes” adds 1 point to the score.

```Python

def score_prep_plan(prep_plan):
    score = 0
    if "priority" in prep_plan and any(prep_plan["priority"].values()):
        score += 1
    if any("SQL" in step or "Flask" in step for step in prep_plan.get("steps", [])):
        score += 1
    if any("build" in step or "practice" in step for step in prep_plan.get("steps", [])):
        score += 1
    if len(prep_plan.get("steps", [])) >= 3:
        score += 1
    if "confidence" in prep_plan.get("summary", "").lower():
        score += 1
    return min(score, 5)
```

# Metrics Definitions 


⭐ Step 1 — Define the Metrics You Want to Track
From your table, you already have the raw ingredients.
Here are the 6 performance metrics you can compute over time:
1. Fit Score Stability
- Measures how consistent the FitGraph score is for the same resume + JD.
- Formula:
variance of Fit Score across repeated runs
2. Skill Extraction Accuracy
- Measures how often the model identifies the correct matching/missing skills.
- Formula:
# of correct skills / total expected skills
3. Prep Plan Quality Trend
- Average score over time.
- Formula:
mean(Prep Plan Quality)
4. Mock Interview Depth Trend
- Measures how deep and structured the interview questions are.
- Formula:
mean(Mock Interview Depth)
5. Resume Rewrite Quality Trend
- Measures how well the model rewrites resumes.
- Formula:
mean(Resume Rewrite Quality)
6. JSON Reliability Score
- Measures how often the model returns valid JSON.
- Formula:
# of valid JSON outputs / total runs

⭐ Step 2 — Add Derived Columns to Your Sheet
Extend your sheet with these new columns:
Consistency Score
Skill Extraction Accuracy
JSON Reliability (1 or 0)
Overall Quality Score


Consistency Score
If you run the same test case multiple times:
- Low variance = high consistency
- High variance = unstable model behavior
Skill Extraction Accuracy
You manually define the “expected skills” for each JD.
Then compare Gemini’s output to your expected list.
JSON Reliability
- 1 = JSON valid
- 0 = JSON missing or malformed
Overall Quality Score
Weighted formula (you can tune weights later):
Overall Score = 
  (Fit Score * 0.2) +
  (Prep Plan Quality * 0.2) +
  (Mock Interview Depth * 0.2) +
  (Resume Rewrite Quality * 0.2) +
  (JSON Reliability * 0.2)


This gives you a single number per test case.

⭐ Step 3 — Use the Data to Evaluate the App Over Time
Once you have 20–50 test cases, you can compute:
1. Model Stability
- Is the Fit Score fluctuating too much?
- Are skill matrices consistent?
2. Model Quality
- Are prep plans improving?
- Are resume rewrites getting more structured?
3. JSON Reliability
- If JSON reliability is < 0.8 → prompt needs refinement.
4. JD‑Specific Weaknesses
Example:
- For Data Analyst roles → missing Pandas often?
- For Backend roles → missing API design often?
5. Resume‑Specific Weaknesses
Example:
- For freshers → model overestimates experience?
- For mid‑level → model underestimates depth?

⭐ Step 4 — Use Metrics to Improve the App
Your metrics will tell you:
If JSON reliability is low → tighten system prompt
If Fit Score variance is high → lower temperature
If skill extraction accuracy is low → add examples
If prep plan quality is low → add structure templates
If mock interview depth is inconsistent → add interview patterns
This is how you evolve CareerPilot from: “LLM-powered app” → “Reliable, production-grade AI system.”

⭐ Step 5 — Build a Dashboard (Optional but powerful)
Later, you can build a simple dashboard (Streamlit or Grafana) showing:
- Average Fit Score
- JSON Reliability %
- Prep Plan Quality trend
- Mock Interview Depth trend
- Resume Rewrite Quality trend
- Skill extraction accuracy
- Consistency score
This becomes your internal QA dashboard.

⭐ Summary (Copy‑Ready for Your Team)

We will use the test-case data to compute:
- Fit Score Stability
- Skill Extraction Accuracy
- Prep Plan Quality Trend
- Mock Interview Depth Trend
- Resume Rewrite Quality Trend
- JSON Reliability Score
- Overall Quality Score

These metrics will help us:
- Evaluate model consistency
- Identify weak areas
- Improve prompts
- Tune temperature
- Strengthen JSON structure
- Track improvements over time
